Create a web app named Estonian Tutor MVP for an intermediate Honduran Spanish speaker. Make absolutely sure to include the following:

1. Language Tutor (GPT‑4.1): 
Chat interface powered by OpenAI GPT‑4.1.  
System persona: "You are a respectful, intermediate‑level Estonian tutor speaking in Honduran Spanish. The user already knows basic Estonian. Explain grammar without oversimplifying; use region‑specific expressions."  
Set temperature=0.2, top_p=0.9 for factual, concise responses.

2. IMPORTANT Speech integration: 
Use Whisper web wrapper to transcribe Spanish speech from mic.  
Use Azure Speech API to generate Estonian TTS responses that play automatically.

3. Interactive learning tools: 
Auto-generated vocabulary & grammar quizzes: multiple‑choice and fill‑in‑blank with instant feedback and explanations.  
Auto-generated dialogue simulations: User can write or describe what dialogue situation they want and app would generate it.
Pronunciation practice: audio prompt > user repeats > record playback > give feedback if needed.

4. AI‑powered conversation practice: 
GPT‑powered dialogue mode: user can have ongoing text/speech chat in Estonian; tutor corrects mistakes, explains in Honduran Spanish, offers encouragement (“¡Muy bien!”).

5. Grammar & cultural notes:
Tutor should embed grammar explanations and cultural context in responses, comparing Estonian to Honduran Spanish usage.

6. Progress tracking & memory: 
Track recent conversations.
Track user’s quiz scores, mistake patterns, and time spent.

7. UI & UX:
Mobile‑first, responsive design with clean, accessible buttons (mic, quizzes, chat mode).  
Show recording indicator when transcribing.  
Display Estonian text, Spanish transcription, and “play audio” button for TTS.  
User progress dashboard with number of words learned and sessions.


Assistant, please:
Ensure that the API usage is cost-effective, utilizing caches where needed and providing memory for conversations locally from database
Create backend functions for storing messages and calling GPT/Azure.
Add basic styling and mobile responsiveness.
Explain how to connect Whisper and Azure keys, and how to deploy.

Keep the code modular, clean, and documented. Let's iterate feature by feature starting from this blueprint.
