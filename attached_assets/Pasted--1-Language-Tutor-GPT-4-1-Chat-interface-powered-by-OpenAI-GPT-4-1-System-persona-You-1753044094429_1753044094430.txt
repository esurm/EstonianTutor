Chat interface powered by OpenAI GPT‑4.1.  
System persona: "You are a respectful, Estonian tutor speaking in Honduran Spanish. Explain grammar without oversimplifying; use region‑specific expressions."  
Set temperature=0.2, top_p=0.9 for factual, concise responses.
Also the GPT 4.1 should be able to to adjust it's tutor persona to the CEFR difficulty chosen by user (existing function)

2. IMPORTANT Speech integration: 
Use Whisper web wrapper to transcribe Spanish or Estonian user spoken speech from microphone.
Use Azure Speech API to generate Estonian (Anu) or Honduran (Carlos) TTS responses that I can manually play and pause.
CURRENT BUG: If I press Play button, it does not change to Pause button when message is playing but it should.

3. Interactive learning tools: 
IMPORTANT CURRENT BUG: When GPT gives answers with **word** it means it wants it to make it bold. This does not translate to current UI but TTS is reading asterisk asterisk, that should not happen.
GPT attempts at formatting text should be shown on end-user UI properly.
Default Tutor de Estonio window: GPT‑powered dialogue mode: user can have ongoing text/speech chat in Estonian; tutor corrects mistakes, explains in Honduran Spanish, offers encouragement when applicable.
Auto-generated vocabulary & grammar quizzes: multiple‑choice and fill‑in‑blank with instant feedback and explanations.  
Auto-generated dialogue simulations: User can write or describe what dialogue situation they want and app would generate it. It would change the "Tutor de Estonio" chatbox to
"Simulación de Diálogo" and change it's title panel background color to fit the "Simulación de Diálogo" panel background color.
Pronunciation practice: Change the Tutor de Estonio box accordingly like the dialogue practice box mentioned before.
Workflow would be: User enters/records words or topic to practice pronounciation > AI gives pronouncation audio > user repeats > AI gives feedback and offers to try again if bad pronouncation or continue to new words.
Ejercisios de Gramatica should be interactive dialogue with the AI to provide user with explanations about grammar as it is intended.

5. Grammar & cultural notes:
Tutor should embed grammar explanations and cultural context in responses, comparing Estonian to Honduran Spanish usage.

6. Progress tracking & memory: 
Track recent conversations to database to ensure the AI has some kind of memory. But only basic references not to overloard the input/output for API too much.

Assistant, please:
Ensure that the API usage is cost-effective, utilizing caches where needed and providing memory for conversations locally from database
